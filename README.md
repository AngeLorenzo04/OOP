# Esercizi [OOP] - Unimore, Ingegneria Informatica (Prof. Nicola Bicocchi)

This repository serves as a personal collection of exercises and solutions related to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exam at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UNIMORE), specifically for the Computer Engineering course taught by Professor Nicola Bicocchi.

## Repository Structure

The project is structured to organize different types of exercises and related code. Below is a breakdown of the key directories:
```
.
├── .idea/                 # IntelliJ IDEA project files
├── src/                   # Source code
│   ├── main/              # Main application source code
│   │   └── java/          # Java source files
│   │       ├── array/     # Exercises related to arrays
│   │       ├── oop/       # Core OOP concepts and exercises
│   │       ├── org/       # (Potentially for organizational packages or specific problems)
│   │       ├── string/    # Exercises involving string manipulation
│   │       └── warmup/    # Introductory or basic exercises
│   └── test/              # Test files (e.g., JUnit tests for exercises)
├── target/                # Compiled classes and build artifacts
├── .gitignore             # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
└── pom.xml                # Maven Project Object Model file
```

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

* **Store and organize:** Keep a centralized place for all OOP exercises encountered during the course and exam preparation.
* **Practice and review:** Provide a practical environment to write, test, and refine solutions to various OOP problems.
* **Reference:** Serve as a personal reference for common OOP patterns, data structures (like arrays and strings), and problem-solving approaches.

## Usage

To use or explore this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Esercizi-OOP.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Esercizi-OOP.git)
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username if you've hosted it there.)
2.  **Open in IntelliJ IDEA:** This project is set up as a Maven project, making it easy to import and work with in IntelliJ IDEA.
3.  **Explore the `src/main/java` directory:** Navigate through the packages (`array`, `oop`, `string`, `warmup`) to find specific exercise implementations.
4.  **Run tests (if available):** If there are corresponding test files in `src/test/java`, you can run them to verify the correctness of the solutions.

## Contributing (Self-Contribution/Notes)

While this is primarily a personal repository, any future additions or improvements might include:

* Adding more detailed comments to complex solutions.
* Including problem statements or links to original exercise descriptions.
* Refactoring code for better readability or efficiency.
